Setup MySQL Configuration for Secure Credential Storage
To securely store MySQL credentials, you can use a MySQL configuration file (my.cnf). Follow these steps to create and configure the file:

1. Create a my.cnf File: If it doesn't exist already, create a my.cnf file in your home directory by running the following command:


touch ~/.my.cnf


2. Open the my.cnf File: Use a text editor (e.g., nano, vim) to open the my.cnf file:

nano ~/.my.cnf

3. Add MySQL Credentials: Inside the my.cnf file, add the MySQL credentials under the [client] section:

[client]
user=root   #username of MySQL
password=your_mysql_password #password of MySQL


4. Replace your_mysql_password with your actual MySQL root password.

Save and Close the File: After adding the credentials, save and close the my.cnf file.

By following these steps, you ensure that MySQL reads the credentials from the my.cnf file, enhancing security by avoiding passing passwords directly in commands.
