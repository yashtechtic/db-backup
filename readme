## Setup MySQL Configuration for Secure Credential Storage

To securely store MySQL credentials, you can use a MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf`). Follow these steps to create and configure the file:

1. **Create a `my.cnf` File**: If it doesn't exist already, create a `my.cnf` file in your home directory by running the following command:

   ```bash
   touch ~/.my.cnf
   ```

2. **Open the `my.cnf` File**: Use a text editor (e.g., nano, vim) to open the `my.cnf` file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.my.cnf
   ```

3. **Add MySQL Credentials**: Inside the `my.cnf` file, add the MySQL credentials under the `[client]` section:

   ```makefile
   [client]
   user=root   #username of mysql
   password=your_mysql_password #password of mysql
   ```

   Replace `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL root password.

4. **Save and Close the File**: After adding the credentials, save and close the `my.cnf` file.

By following these steps, you ensure that MySQL reads the credentials from the `my.cnf` file, enhancing security by avoiding passing passwords directly in commands.
